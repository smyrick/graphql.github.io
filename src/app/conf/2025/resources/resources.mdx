## Code of Conduct

The GraphQL Foundation and the Linux Foundation are dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for participants at all of our events, whether they are held in person or virtually. GraphQLConf is a working conference intended for professional networking and collaboration within the open source community. It exists to encourage the open exchange of ideas and expression and requires an environment that recognizes the inherent worth of every person and group. While at GraphQLConf or related ancillary or social events, any participants, including members, speakers, attendees, volunteers, sponsors, exhibitors, booth staff and anyone else, should not engage in harassment in any form.

This Code of Conduct may be revised at any time by The GraphQL Foundation or The Linux Foundation and the terms are non-negotiable. Your registration for or attendance at GraphQL, whether in person or virtually, indicates your agreement to abide by this policy and its terms.

Please read the full [Code of Conduct](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/about/code-of-conduct/) for the complete policy and terms.

## Diversity & Inclusion 

Education and collaboration are vital to the future of the open source ecosystem, and it is imperative to us that everyone in the community that wants to participate feels welcome to do so regardless of gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, race, ethnicity, age, religion or economic status. Our [code of conduct](#code-of-conduct) outlines our expectations for all those who participate in our community, as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior.

We offer diversity and have considered a broad range of both onsite resources and emergency resources as well as a health & safety policy.

If you have ideas on how we can create a more inclusive event, please do not hesitate to let us know. Contact Emily Ruf, Event Director, at [eruf@linuxfoundation.org](mailto:eruf@linuxfoundation.org).

## Health & Safety

Check this page for updates about health and safety recommendations.

Our community's well-being is extremely important to us, and creating a safe, worry-free event is our top priority. We will adjust our health and safety protocols as needed while updating this page with information about plans for our attendees onsite. We continue to look to local municipality guidelines to make the best and most informed decisions around onsite safety and requirements. All in-person attendance requirements are subject to change based on local guidelines.

### Food Allergies 

The Linux Foundation believes it's essential to prioritize the safety and well-being of all attendees, including those with food allergies.

- We aim to provide a variety of choices to cater to various needs such as vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free, dairy-free, and peanut-free.  
- All food items will be clearly labeled at the event, indicating the ingredients used and any potential allergens present.

If you have a food allergy we need to be aware of, please email us at [graphql_events@linuxfoundation.org](mailto:graphql_events@linuxfoundation.org).

### Reserved Seating

Reserved seating is available in each session for those who have accessibility needs. If you need assistance onsite, please ask a staff member.

### Quiet Room

This is a physical space where attendees can go if they feel unable to interact with other attendees for a period of time. Please refrain from conversation, interaction, or work in these spaces.

### Communication Stickers 

Attendees can pick up communication stickers to add to their badges at registration. Communication stickers indicate an attendee's requested level of interaction with other attendees and press (including photographers and videographers).

Green \= Open to communicate.  
Yellow \= Only if you know me, please.  
Red \= I'm not interested in communicating (or being videotaped or photographed) at this time.

Please be respectful of attendee communication preferences.

### Share your Pronouns 

Stickers will be available at registration to add to your badge. Please be respectful of attendees’ pronouns.

### All-Gender Restrooms 

We will designate specific restrooms as all-gender for attendees who feel more comfortable using those facilities.

### First Aid/Medical Assistance 

If you require first aid or medical assistance, please visit our registration desk or a venue information desk. For emergencies, please dial 112\.

### How to Handle a Harassment Report 

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of the event staff immediately. Event staff can be identified by staff badges and/or shirts onsite and can be found at the event registration counter at any time. Our staff has had incident response training, responds to harassment reports and does so in accordance with the process recommended by the Ada Initiative, which can be found [here](https://geekfeminism.wikia.org/wiki/Conference_anti-harassment/Responding_to_reports) on the Geek Feminism Wiki.

Conference staff will be happy to help participants contact hotel/venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the conference.

If you are planning to attend an upcoming event and have concerns regarding another individual who may be present, please reach out to us pre-event. Precautions will be taken to ensure a victim’s comfort and safety, including, but not limited to providing an escort, prepping onsite event staff, keeping victim and harasser from attending the same talks/social events and providing onsite contact cell phone numbers for immediate contact.
