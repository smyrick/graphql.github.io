# GraphQL Best Practices

The GraphQL specification is intentionally silent on a handful of important
issues facing APIs such as dealing with the network, authorization, and
pagination. This doesn't mean that there aren't solutions for these issues when
using GraphQL, just that they're outside the description about what GraphQL _is_
and instead just common practice.

The articles in this section should not be taken as gospel, and in some cases
may rightfully be ignored in favor of some other approach. Some articles
introduce some of the philosophy developed within Facebook around designing and
deploying GraphQL services, while others are more tactical suggestions for
solving common problems like serving over HTTP and performing authorization.
