# Authorization

<p className="learn-subtitle">
  Delegate authorization logic to the business logic layer
</p>

Most APIs will need to secure access to certain types of data depending on who
requested it, and GraphQL is no different. GraphQL execution should begin after
[authentication](/graphql-js/authentication-and-express-middleware/) middleware
confirms the user's identity and passes that information to the GraphQL layer.
But after that, you still need to determine if the authenticated user is allowed
to view the data provided by the specific fields that were included in the
request. On this page, we'll explore how a GraphQL schema can support
authorization.

## Type and field authorization

Authorization is a type of business logic that describes whether a given
user/session/context has permission to perform an action or see a piece of data.
For example:

_"Only authors can see their drafts"_

Enforcing this behavior should happen in the
[business logic layer](/learn/thinking-in-graphs/#business-logic-layer). Let's
consider the following `Post` type defined in a schema:

```graphql
type Post {
  authorId: ID!
  body: String
}
```

In this example, we can imagine that when a request initially reaches the
server, authentication middleware will first check the user's credentials and
add information about their identity to the `context` object of the GraphQL
request so that this data is available in every field resolver for the duration
of its execution.

If a post's body should only be visible to the user who authored it, then we
will need to check that the authenticated user's ID matches the post's
`authorId` value. It may be tempting to place authorization logic in the
resolver for the post's `body` field like so:

```js
function Post_body(obj, args, context, info) {
  // return the post body only if the user is the post's author
  if (context.user && context.user.id === obj.authorId) {
    return obj.body
  }
  return null
}
```

Notice that we define "author owns a post" by checking whether the post's
`authorId` field equals the current user’s `id`. Can you spot the problem? We
would need to duplicate this code for each entry point into the service. Then if
the authorization logic is not kept perfectly in sync, users could see different
data depending on which API they use. Yikes! We can avoid that by having a
[single source of truth](/learn/thinking-in-graphs/#business-logic-layer) for
authorization, instead of putting it the GraphQL layer.

Defining authorization logic inside the resolver is fine when learning GraphQL
or prototyping. However, for a production codebase, delegate authorization logic
to the business logic layer. Here’s an example of how authorization of the
`Post` type's fields could be implemented separately:

```js
// authorization logic lives inside `postRepository`
export const postRepository = {
  getBody({ user, post }) {
    if (user?.id && user.id === post.authorId) {
      return post.body
    }
    return null
  }
}
```

The resolver function for the post's `body` field would then call a
`postRepository` method instead of implementing the authorization logic
directly:

```js
import { postRepository } from "postRepository"

function Post_body(obj, args, context, info) {
  // return the post body only if the user is the post's author
  return postRepository.getBody({ user: context.user, post: obj })
}
```

In the example above, we see that the business logic layer requires the caller
to provide a user object, which is available in the `context` object for the
GraphQL request. We recommend passing a fully-hydrated user object instead of an
opaque token or API key to your business logic layer. This way, we can handle
the distinct concerns of
[authentication](/graphql-js/authentication-and-express-middleware/) and
authorization in different stages of the request processing pipeline.

## Using type system directives

In the example above, we saw how authorization logic can be delegated to the
business logic layer through a function that is called in a field resolver. In
general, it is recommended to perform all authorization logic in that layer, but
if you decide to implement authorization in the GraphQL layer instead then one
approach is to use [type system directives](/learn/schema/#directives).

For example, a directive such as `@auth` could be defined in the schema with
arguments that indicate what roles or permissions a user must have to access the
data provided by the types and fields where the directive is applied:

```graphql
directive @auth(rule: Rule) on FIELD_DEFINITION

enum Rule {
  IS_AUTHOR
}

type Post {
  authorId: ID!
  body: String @auth(rule: IS_AUTHOR)
}
```

It would be up to the GraphQL implementation to determine how an `@auth`
directive affects execution when a client makes a request that includes the
`body` field for `Post` type. However, the authorization logic should remain
delegated to the business logic layer.

## Recap

To recap these recommendations for authorization in GraphQL:

- Authorization logic should be delegated to the business logic layer, not the
  GraphQL layer
- After execution begins, a GraphQL server should make decisions about whether
  the client that made the request is authorized to access data for the included
  fields
- Type system directives may be defined and added to the types and fields in a
  schema to apply generalized authorization rules
