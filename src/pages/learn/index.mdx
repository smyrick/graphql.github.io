# Introduction to GraphQL

<p className="learn-subtitle">
  Learn about GraphQL, how it works, and how to use it
</p>

GraphQL is a query language for your API, and a server-side runtime for
executing queries using a type system you define for your data. The
[GraphQL specification](https://spec.graphql.org/) was open-sourced in 2015 and
has since been implemented in a variety of programming languages. GraphQL isn't
tied to any specific database or storage engine—it is backed by your existing
code and data.

<Callout type="info">
  If you're already familiar with GraphQL and would like to read documentation
  on how to build a GraphQL service, then there are libraries to help you
  implement GraphQL in [many different
  languages](/community/tools-and-libraries/?tags=server). There are also many
  libraries available that allow [client applications to query existing GraphQL
  APIs](/community/tools-and-libraries/?tags=client).

## Describe your API with a type system

A GraphQL service is created by
[defining types and their fields](/learn/schema/), and then writing a function
for each field to [provide the required data](/learn/execution/). For example, a
GraphQL service that tells you the name of a logged-in user might look like
this:

```graphql
type Query {
  me: User
}

type User {
  name: String
}
```

Along with functions for each field on each type:

```js
// Provide data for the `me` field on the `Query` type
function Query_me(query, args, context, info) {
  return context.request.auth.user
}

// Provide data for the `name` field on the `User` type
function User_name(user, args, context, info) {
  return context.db.getUserFullName(user.id)
}
```

In the example above, the function that provides data for the `me` field on the
`Query` type uses information about the authenticated user who made the request,
while the `name` field on the `User` type is populated by using that user's ID
to fetch their full name from a database.

## Query exactly what you need

After a GraphQL service is running (typically at a URL on a web service), it can
receive [GraphQL queries](/learn/queries/) to validate and execute from clients.
The service first checks a query to ensure it only refers to the types and
fields defined for the API and then runs the provided functions to produce a
result.

For example, the query:

```graphql
{
  me {
    name
  }
}
```

Could produce the following JSON result:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "me": {
      "name": "Luke Skywalker"
    }
  }
}
```

With even a simple query, we can see some of the key features that make GraphQL
so powerful. The client can make queries to the API that mirror the structure of
the data that they need and then receive just that data in the expected shape
with a single request—and without having to worry about which underlying data
sources provided it.

## Evolve your API without versioning

Client requirements change over time and GraphQL allows your API to evolve in
response to those needs and without the overhead of managing different API
versions. For example, if a new feature calls for more specific name values to
be available, then the `User` type could be updated as follows:

```graphql
type User {
  fullName: String
  nickname: String
  name: String @deprecated(reason: "Use `fullName`.")
}
```

Client tooling will encourage developers to use the new fields and remove usage
of the deprecated `name` field. The field can be removed once it is determined
it is no longer used; in the meantime GraphQL will continue to provide its data
as expected.

## Try it out!

The best way to learn GraphQL is to start writing queries. The query editors
used throughout this guide are **interactive**, so try adding an `id` and
`appearsIn` fields to the `hero` object to see an updated result:

```graphql
# { "graphiql": true }
{
  hero {
    name
    # add additional fields here!
  }
}
```

<Callout type="info">
  The examples in this guide are based on [a modified version of the SWAPI
  GraphQL
  schema](https://github.com/graphql/graphql.github.io/blob/source/src/components/marked/swapi-schema.tsx).
  Because these queries are designed for illustrative purposes, they will not
  run on the full version of the SWAPI GraphQL API due to differences between
  the two schemas. [You can try the full version of the API
  here.](https://graphql.org/swapi-graphql/)

## Next steps

Now that you know some key GraphQL concepts, you're ready to learn about all of
the different aspects of its [type system](/learn/schema/).
